# I stole it from somewhere idk
### For hun layout:
download the `hun.keylayout` file then,
put it here `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
### For home the keybindings:
open the terminal 
download the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` file then,
put it here `/Library/KeyBindings/`

The folder doesn't exist by default you can run the following command to create it and open the destination

You should be in the home folder under `/Users/[something]`

(if you are not sure the following command: `pwd` (aka print working directory))

Run the following command to create the `KeyBindings` folder with destination opening

`mkdir  ./Library/KeyBindings && open ./Library/KeyBindings`

when the command executes put the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` file in the newly opened Finder
# If you are modifying the keybindings make sure to restart the pc (or vm, duh)
