# I stole it from somewhere idk

### For hun layout:

download the `hun.keylayout` file then,

put it here `/Users/[something]/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`

### For home the keybindings:

open the terminal and

download the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` file then,

put it here `/Users/[something]/Library/KeyBindings/`

The folder does not exist by default. You can run the following command to create it and open the destination.

You must be in the home folder, your path should be `/Users/[something]`

(if you are not sure run the following command: `pwd` (aka print working directory))

Run the following command to create the `KeyBindings` folder with destination opening

`mkdir ./Library/KeyBindings && open ./Library/KeyBindings`

when the command executes put the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` file in the newly opened Finder
# If you are modifying the keybindings make sure to restart the pc (or vm, duh)
